# Email-Hunter

Email Hunter uses selenium to find emails in a specific website.

To setup the project:
* Run `git clone https://github.com/LordA2117/Email-Hunter.git`
* `cd Email-hunter.git`
* `pip install selenium chromedriver_autoinstaller geckodriver_autoinstaller termcolor`

It is better to create a virtual environment for the project.

To run the project first change your working directory to the project folder and then run `python hunter.py`

Run the project in the admin admin account just to be safe.
